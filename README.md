***Convert Beat Saber Custom Songs to the OLD format***

*Want to go the other way (from OLD to NEW format) around?* Use [this](https://github.com/lolPants/songe-converter) tool from lolpants.

## Usage
Drag one or multiple folders containing a beatmap's `info.json` file onto the binary.

Otherwise pass them as command line arguments.

## Notice
**It will delete the old dat-files (and ðŸ¥š).**

I developed this tool pretty quickly with not much testing for the current situation where MediocreMapper can't read the new format.

This is mainly useful if you have converted your WIP map and didn't keep a backup or wanted to look at a map in the editor which is already in the new format.

***Convert Beat Saber Custom Songs to the OLD format***

*Want to go the other way (from OLD to NEW format) around?* Use [this](https://github.com/lolPants/songe-converter) tool from lolpants.

## Usage
Drag one or multiple folders containing a beatmap's `info.json` file onto the binary.

Otherwise pass them as command line arguments.

## Notice
**It will delete the old dat-files (and ðŸ¥š).**

This is mainly useful if you have converted your WIP map and didn't keep a backup or wanted to look at a map in the editor which is already in the new format.

Since v0.2.0, it should also work for converting files from the official level editor.
